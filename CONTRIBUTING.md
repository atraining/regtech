# Contribute

## New Company

- Add the domain of your company to "companies.txt"
- Create a [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)
- The Readme.md will be updated as soon your branch is merged into the main branch

## Improve Code

The script to retrieve the company information is limited. Some domains can yet not be accessed. Feel free to improve the proof of concept to scrape the company information.
